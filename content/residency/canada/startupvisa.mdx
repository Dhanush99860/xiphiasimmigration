### Overview
Canada’s Start-up Visa program offers a direct path to permanent residence for entrepreneurs who launch innovative businesses in Canada. Unlike passive investor schemes, this program requires active involvement and a commitment to job creation. Successful applicants can bring up to four co-founders and their families, receive permanent residence immediately, and later qualify for citizenship.

### Investment Overview
You don’t need to invest your own capital if you’re admitted to a designated business incubator. However, if you seek funding, you must secure:

- **CAD 75,000** from an approved angel investor group; or  
- **CAD 200,000** from a designated venture capital fund.

Government fees for the application range from **CAD 1,810–2,385** for the principal applicant, plus **CAD 1,525** for a spouse and **CAD 260** per child. Applicants must also demonstrate settlement funds (e.g. about CAD 13,000 for a single applicant, increasing with family size) to support themselves upon arrival.

### Comparison with Provincial Entrepreneur Programs
Below is a high-level comparison of the Start-up Visa with two popular provincial entrepreneur programs:

| Program | Investment & Net Worth | Path to PR | Key differences |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Start-up Visa (Federal)** | Investment not required if accepted into an incubator; otherwise CAD 75k (angel) or CAD 200k (VC). No formal net-worth threshold.| Permanent residence issued up front; work permit optional.| Requires support from designated organizations; PR isn’t tied to business success.|
| **Ontario OINP Entrepreneur** | Net worth ≥ CAD 800k in the GTA or CAD 400k outside; personal investment ≥ CAD 600k in the GTA or CAD 200k outside.| Two-step process: obtain work permit, run the business for ~20 months, then receive nomination and apply for PR.| Must create at least 1–2 jobs; PR only after meeting business milestones.|
| **British Columbia PNP Entrepreneur (Base)** | Net worth ≥ CAD 600k; personal investment ≥ CAD 200k and at least one-third ownership.| Two-step process: obtain work permit, establish business, then nomination for PR.| Must create at least 1 job; CLB 4 language requirement. |
